Dismon
Rust-based terminal app focused on distributed system monitoring (Distributed Monitoring)

System Monitoring: Fetch system metrics like CPU usage, memory, network, and disk activity from each node in your distributed system.
Networking: Use async networking (e.g., TCP or HTTP) to collect metrics from distributed nodes.
Terminal UI: Display the metrics in an interactive terminal interface.
Node Management: Allow adding, removing, and listing distributed nodes.
Alerts and Logs: Trigger alerts based on thresholds (e.g., high CPU usage).
